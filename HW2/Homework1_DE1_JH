Use birdstrikes;

#Exercise 1
#Based on the previous chapter, create a table called “employee” with two columns: “id” and “employee_name”. NULL values should not be accepted for these 2 columns.
CREATE TABLE employee
(id INTEGER NOT NULL,
employee_name VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL);
#Answer 1: Table has been created.

#Exercise 2
#What state figures in the 145th line of our database?
SELECT *  FROM birdstrikes LIMIT 144, 1;
#Answer 2: Tennesee


#Exercise 3
#What is flight_date of the latest birstrike in this database?
SELECT * from birdstrikes as b ORDER BY b.flight_date DESC LIMIT 1;
#Answer 3: 2000-04-18

#Exercise4
#What was the cost of the 50th most expensive damage?
SELECT DISTINCT (cost) from birdstrikes ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 49,1;
#Answer 4: 5345


#Exercise5
#What state figures in the 2nd record, if you filter out all records which have no state and no bird_size specified?
#Mine:
SELECT (state) FROM birdstrikes WHERE state!='' AND state IS NOT NULL AND bird_size!='' AND bird_size IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1,1;
#Formated:
SELECT state FROM birdstrikes
    WHERE state IS NOT NULL AND state != ''
    AND bird_size IS NOT NULL AND bird_size != ''
    LIMIT 1,1;
#Answer 5: Colorado

#Exercise6
#How many days elapsed between the current date and the flights happening in week 52, for incidents from Colorado? (Hint: use NOW, DATEDIFF, WEEKOFYEAR)
#Mine
SELECT DATEDIFF(NOW(), flight_date) AS DAYS
FROM birdstrikes
WHERE state = 'Colorado' AND WEEKOFYEAR(flight_date) = 52;
#Correct:
SELECT DATEDIFF(tab.flight_date, NOW()) FROM birdstrikes as tab WHERE WEEKOFYEAR(tab.flight_date) =52 AND state="Colorado"

/*Answer 6:
Mine 8681
Correct: 7576*/
